# Core Gameplay

## Overview
StrategyForge is a real-time strategy game centered around a mobile mechanical base that must navigate to and hold strategic positions on the map. Players must balance resource gathering, base development, and combat to outmaneuver opponents and secure victory.

## Game Modes
- **Skirmish**: 1v1 or team battles against AI or players
- **Campaign**: Story-driven missions with unique objectives


## Core Mechanics

### Mobile Base
- The player controls a large, slow-moving mechanical base
- Base can be upgraded with various modules that attach to it
- Movement speed is affected by the base's size and modules

### Resource Management
- Three primary resources: Wood, Stone, Iron Ore and Copper Ore
- Resources are gathered by specialized units
- Resources are used for constructing buildings and training units

### Base Building
- Buildings are constructed as modules that attach to the main base
- Each module serves a specific purpose (defense, production, etc.)
- Limited attachment points create strategic placement decisions about module placement
- Some modules increase the attachement points but are expensive and take time to build
- Some modules can be upgraded for efficiency

### Combat
- Real-time combat with various unit types
- units have attack and defensive capabilities
- units have a movement speed and a range
- Defensive structures provide increased defense.
- Formation of units can provide increased defense and attack capabilities.
- Some units can be upgraded for efficiency.
- Some units are able to repair other units.

## Tech Tree
- Unit types become available as the player researches new technologies.
- Technologies are unlocked by spending research points that are gained by combat and building research labs.
- Technologies can be researched at the technology lab.

## Victory Conditions
- Capture and hold strategic points on the map
- Eliminate all enemy bases
- Achieve specific mission objectives (in campaign mode)
