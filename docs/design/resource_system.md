# Resource System

## Resource Types

### Primary Resources
1. **Wood**
   - Gathered from trees and forests
   - Used for basic structures and units
   - Most abundant but least valuable resource

2. **Stone**
   - Mined from rock formations
   - Used for defensive structures and upgrades
   - Medium abundance

3. **Iron**
   - Mined from iron deposits
   - Used for advanced units and structures
   - Medium resource

4. **Copper**
   - Mined from copper deposits
   - Used for advanced units and structures
   - Medium resource

5. **Alloy**
   - created from primary resources
   - Used for advanced units and structures

6. **Refined**
   - created from alloy and primary resources
   - Used for advanced units and structures
   - Rarest and most valuable resource

## Gathering Mechanics

### Resource Nodes
- **Trees**: Provide Wood
  - Can be harvested by any unit
  - Regrow over time when not fully harvested
  
- **Rock Formations**: Provide Stone
  - Require at least a basic gatherer unit
  - Finite resource that depletes
  
- **Iron Deposits**: Provide Iron
  - Require advanced gatherer units
  - Finite resource node type

- **Copper Deposits**: Provide Copper
  - Require advanced gatherer units
  - Finite resource node type

### Gathering Units
1. **Gatherers**
   - Basic resource collection
   - Can gather Wood and Stone
   - Cheapest unit to produce

2. **Engineers**
   - Advanced resource collection
   - Can gather all resource types
   - More efficient at gathering
   - Can repair structures

## Storage and Management

### Base Storage
- Each base has limited storage capacity
- Storage modules can be added to increase capacity
- Resources beyond capacity are lost

### Resource Processing
- Some resources can be processed into more valuable forms
- Processing buildings required for advanced units/structures
- Adds strategic depth to resource management

## Economic Strategy

### Early Game
- Focus on Wood and basic Stone
- Establish resource gathering operations
- Build basic infrastructure

### Mid Game
- Expand to Stone and Iron
- Upgrade gathering operations
- Balance economy and military

### Late Game
- Secure rare resource nodes
- Optimize resource flow
- Maintain resource advantage

## Special Considerations
- Resource nodes can be contested
- Enemy players can disrupt supply lines
- Strategic placement of storage is important
