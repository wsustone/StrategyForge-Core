# Technology System

## Overview

The Technology System in StrategyForge represents the scientific and engineering advancements that factions can research to gain advantages in combat, resource gathering, and base development. Each faction has a unique technology tree that reflects their cultural and strategic priorities.

Research is conducted at specialized research facilities and requires both resources and time. As technologies are researched, they unlock new units, buildings, modules, and abilities, as well as provide passive bonuses to existing capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### Technology Categories

Technologies are divided into four main categories:

- **Military**: Combat-focused technologies that improve weapons, defenses, and military units
- **Economy**: Technologies that enhance resource gathering, production efficiency, and storage
- **Infrastructure**: Technologies related to base building, expansion, and logistics
- **Special**: Faction-specific unique technologies that define their gameplay style

### Technology Levels

Technologies are organized into progression tiers:

- **Basic**: Fundamental technologies available early in the game
- **Advanced**: More sophisticated technologies that build upon basic research
- **Experimental**: Cutting-edge technologies with powerful but specialized effects
- **Ultimate**: End-game technologies that provide significant advantages

### Research Process

1. **Prerequisites**: Most technologies require previous technologies to be researched first
2. **Resource Cost**: Each technology requires specific resources to begin research
3. **Research Time**: Technologies take time to research, with more advanced technologies requiring longer research periods
4. **Application**: Once researched, technology effects are automatically applied to relevant units and structures

- **Effect System**: Applies the effects of researched technologies to appropriate game entities
- **UI System**: Provides the interface for players to view and interact with the technology tree

Each technology's effects are implemented through the game's component system, modifying attributes, unlocking capabilities, or changing behavior of relevant entities.

## Future Expansions

The technology system is designed to be expandable, with plans for:

- Additional faction-specific technologies
- Dynamic research paths that adapt to player choices
- Technology trading and espionage between factions
